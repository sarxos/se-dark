# se-dark

Dark themes for various StackExchange sites. Still very much a work-in-progress.

Currently working on:

 - Ask Ubuntu (askubuntu.com)
  - Meta (meta.askubuntu.com)
  
 - Stack Overflow (stackoverflow.com)
   - Meta (meta.stackoverflow.com)
   

If there's an element that hasn't been changed or something else looks bad, either submit a pull request with your changes or open a new issue.

#INSTALLATION

 1. You'll need Greasemonkey (Firefox) or Tampermonkey (Chrome) installed for this plugin to work properly.
 2. Once you have either one installed, simply click the link for the raw JS and you will be prompted to install it.
 2. You can also install it via clicking the Tampermonkey then 'Add a New Script' then pasting the sedark.user.js code to the editor. You need to save it by Ctrl+S or clicking to the Save button and refresh the web pages/restart the browser.
 3. You may need to restart your browser. You will need to refresh affected web pages.

#NOTES

 - The script will send data to another server. However, this data is _only_ used to serve as a counter for the number is active users. If you do not want this behavior, there is a comment in the JS indicating what to delete. (THIS HAS NOT YET BEEN IMPLEMENTED)
